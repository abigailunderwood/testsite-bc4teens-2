	abstract = {Implementation blueprints are comprehensive plans that describe implementation strategies, goals, timelines, and key personnel necessary for launching new interventions. Although blueprints are a foundational step in driving intervention rollout, little is known about how blueprints are developed, refined, and used in practice. The objective of this study was to describe a systematic, collaborative approach to developing, refining, and utilizing a formal implementation blueprint for scaling up the Contraception Care at Behavioral Health Pavilion (CC@BHP) intervention for adolescents hospitalized in psychiatric units within a pediatric hospital in the United States. In Stage 1 (Planning/Preparation), we assembled a Research Advisory Board (RAB) of 41 multidisciplinary members and conducted a formative evaluation to identify potential barriers to CC@BHP implementation. Barriers were mapped to implementation strategies using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) tool and used to create an initial blueprint. In Stage 2 (Development/Implementation), RAB members used activity logs to track implementation activities over the 18-month study period, which were then mapped to formal implementation strategies used to further develop the blueprint. About 30\% of strategies were situated in the ‘Train and Educate Stakeholders’ ERIC category, 20\% in ‘Use Evaluative and Iterative Strategies,’ and 16\% in ‘Develop Stakeholder Interrelationships’ category. In Stage 3 (Synthesis/Refinement), the final blueprint was refined, consisting of 16 goals linked to 10 strategies for pre-implementation and 6 strategies for implementation. Feedback on the blueprint emphasized the role of the project champion in translating the blueprint into smaller, actionable steps for implementers.},
